## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 4 Example 4: layable Maze (JSON + Level class + Player class)

## Description

Based on example 4 I added a 3rd level and made it go back to the first level once I was finished

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments.

GenAI was used to identify logic errors causing blank screens and failed level transitions, and to help refactor the sketch.js file so that levels progressed correctly using existing class methods, It was also used to help understand the steps so I could learn to manually alter the code
